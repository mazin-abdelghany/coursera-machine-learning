# Week 10

### Large-scale machine learning
#### Machine learning with "big" data&mdash;i.e., large datasets
- Machine learning is much more successful now than 10 years from now because of the volume of data that is now available to train
- "It's not who has the best algorithms that wins, but who has the most data"
- Learning with large datasets comes with its own computational problems
- Imagine a dataset with m = 100,000,000, gradient descent would have to sum over 100,000,000 training examples

#### Why not use 1,000 examples?
- Perhaps training on 1,000 examples will do just as wel
- The easiest way to assess this is to plot the learning curves

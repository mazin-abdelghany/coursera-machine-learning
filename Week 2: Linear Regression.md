### Multivariate Linear Regression
#### Typical notation:
- n = number of features
- x(i) = features of the i-th training example
	- i.e., x(i) has all the features (e.g., size of house, number of bedrooms) being used to construct the model
- x(i)_j = value of feature j of the i-th training example

#### Hypothesis function for multivariate linear regression

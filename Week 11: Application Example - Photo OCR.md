### Photo OCR Case Study
#### Problem description
- Stands for photo optical character recognition
- Recognize letters and words in images in order to motivate search or copy/paste  

Steps:
1. Detect where text is
2. Character segmentation
3. Classify the characters 
4. (Spelling correction)

- The above is a machine learning pipeline that requires multiple modules
	- Some modules may be machine learning and others not
	- The design and conception of the pipeline itself can have a major impact on performance of the overall algorithm
	- Each of the above modules may be the task of 1-5 engineers
